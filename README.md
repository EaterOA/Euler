# Who is Euler?

The Euler that we're talking about here (not the one who is a few centuries
old) is the creator of Project Euler, at http://projecteuler.net/. It's a site
that offers literally hundreds of programming challenges geared towards
introducing math concepts. I sure learned a thing or two about the magic of
prime numbers there.

I share my solutions to some of these problems here. The vast majority of the
code is written in C++, with a lone python script for those days when even a
Uint-64 is not good enough.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code. Doing the problems is a great
way to learn, but reading about other approaches can be just as educational.
